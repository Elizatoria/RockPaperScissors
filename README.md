The goal is to build a Rock Paper Scissors Game in Vanilla JavaScript, where you play against the computer. Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock, and Rock beats Scissors. HTML and CSS were also used to make it a full webpage.

There are two screens for this project. In one screen, the user selects either rock, paper, or scissors. The second screen reveals who has won the game and an image to click on to be able to play again without refreshing the screen.
